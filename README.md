# Getting started with React-tw-components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was started to give examples of how we can build some components using React and Tailwind CSS.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
